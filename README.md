### 3. Install python packages
when you run
```bash
python3 server.py
```
You may need to install some python packages for that just run the following
```bash
sudo apt install python3-flask
sudo apt install python3-scapy
```
Those should be only two you need

### 4. Running server.py
After you've installed the packages you are ready to run
```bash
server.py
```
simply type
```bash
sudo python3 server.py
```

## Viewing the Dashboard

Open a web browser in the VM and navigate to:

```text
http://<VM_IP_ADDRESS>:8000
```

Example:

```text
http://192.168.1.100:8000
```

The dashboard should load and display the analyzed network traffic data.
